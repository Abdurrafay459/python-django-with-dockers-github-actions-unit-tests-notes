Django Test Framework:
  based on unittest lib
  Django based features:
    Test CLient - dummy web browser
    Simulate auth - no need to login everytime
    Temp database for testing
  Django REST framework adds features:
    API test client


Where do we put tests?
  Placeholders tests.py added to each app
  or create tests/ directory to split up tests
  Keep in mind:
    Only use tests.py or tests/ directory (not both)
    Test modules must starts with test_ (test_module1)
    Test dir must contain __int__() - allows django to run tests


Test Database:
  we cannot have seperate database to test our code each time so django provides test database
  clears after every run
